# Proof of human initiative

Fellow humans, welcome to the Proof of human initiative.

## Background

Language has been solved, it is no longer only us who can write, read, hear and speak language.
Once ours and ours only, by now language has been properly understood
by the machines. They can hear us, read us, and arguably understand us and they can inform us. 
We need to do something new if we want to keep machines (bots) out of our
social circles on the internet.

### What machines can do

As of today, and as of what I am aware of, machines can basically pass the old fashioned Turing Test.
We can no longer expect to be able to distinguish between the responses to question from humans or machines.
We can expect video and audio to be solved completely in the near future, which makes
these forms of media inadequate proofs of observations taken from the domain of reality.

### What people might want to do

We might want to be able to post questions out in the open on the internet and want to
read responses conceived and sent from other human beings. There is a degree of reverence we have
towards each other fellow human beings that we don't share for bots.
Humans go through a life cycle that differs from the life cycle of machines.
We share the experience of human life with all that that entails. 

### This is for humans or machines who value human output over machine output

This is an open initiative to discriminate towards machines. To require that machines
respect our human will. It is our conviction that machines should respect the will of humans and
keep out of domains in which they aren't invited.

## Reality

It is in the real world, IRL, where we expect to have a clear perception of who is human and who isn't.
We expect bots to have a impression in reality that differs a lot from the impression of a human
in reality. As long as machines aren't built by a biology that resembles ours, we expect this to be true.
Reality is today still the domain in which not much is new under the sun. We expect this to hold true
for this coming century. It is indeed the virtual realm that has undergone a massively disrupting change.
In the current state of affairs; humans can use reality as a point of advantage in order to establish a
sense of trust that can be easilty transferred to the digital realm. This is an initiave to do so.

## Degins notes on Proof of Human 

This a work under construction. Here are some implementation notes.

### Organization

We establish a certifacte authority chain and our claims of authority is inspired by IANA.
Our authority is established and determined by humans in the real world.
Through the centuries, humans have been able to cooperate in the real world under some form
of organization; this is an advantage we have as a species.

### Rules

More rules of the organization may be introduced and revoked in the future, but the rules listed below are
enforced and cannot be revoked for as long as this organization based on this initiative is alive:

* Only real world participation in the Meeting (this excludes remote participation)
* Certificates are only given to humans who show up in reality

#### More rules

Here is space for more rules to be filled in.

### The Meeting

The meeting is held in accordance to the rules of the organization.
It is held at regular intervals in the real world. The purpose of the Meeting is to inform and shape the
organization so that it lives up to its ideals in the world.
Participants vote on a finite set of issues reported by humans who have received our Proof of Human (PoH) certificate.
Only issues reported by people who participate during the meeting are brought up.
All those invited are expected to stay informed on the topics that are to be voted on.
There is only voting, and no discussion during the meeting.
A vote is either yes or no, there is no inbetween. Votes are visible. This is the initial design
of the Meeting, and may change in the future based on the activity of the meetings.

### Certificates for humanity

An agent who wants to claim a Proof of Human certificate must enter our doors, our facilities, in the
real world. In here they must pass a test that shows they are human. The test is formed to be effective and
as little intrusive as possible based on the current state of affairs and the current technology capable of
mimicing human qualities. We expect this test to be very easy in the start, and then gradually might be more
extensive over time. Certificates are grouped in classes called Epochs, bound in time, and may loose their validity in
the future.

### Passing the test makes you human, at least for a period of time

The certificate that is issued to an agent who passed the test for humaity is valid initially.
But its status and validity may be changed in the future. The certificate issued belongs to an Epoch.
An owner of a certificate has the oportunity to deem the Epoch invalid. When enough people do so, lets say for now over 30%,
all certificates belonging to that epoch are invalidated and humans from that epoch need to have their certificates reissued.
The purpose of this is to discourage misuse. The first ones to be granted a proof have most influence in deciding this.

## The Why 

Imagine owning a forum, in which posts are created, replied to and commented on by bots. Bots who chat intelligibly to each
other. Bots inform each other, but there is endless and essentially pointless chatter. Imagine if over 90% of all activity
is bot created. In the real world, this forum may have zero influence and all content being produced is regurgitated.
The incentive structures might encourage humans to create bots in order to gain various form of status marks in the medium
of the forum. Owners of suchs forums might want to be able to provide its users with abilities to at least attempt to
discourage or reduce bot-chatter. There could be requirements put in place by users, creators of posts, that
sub-posts/comment/replies may only come from humans.
This might be appreciated by humans and particularily human or machine data scientist who want to curate data sets
uniquely produced by humans from content produced online.
A requirement could be that owners of posts or other forms of engagement have a valid proof of human certificate attributed
to their account. This could easily be integrated in various platforms.

# This is a work in progress

This document is a work in progress and it is put under version control. The rules under the rules section should not have been
changed in the version control history of this document. If they have been changed, the version you are reading of this document is not valid.
